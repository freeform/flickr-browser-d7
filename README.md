flickrbrowser
=================

The start of a Drupal 7 version of Arvin Singla's Flickr Browser module (https://drupal.org/project/flickrbrowser). The conversion from CCK to Drupal 7 entities is not complete. This requires work and will NOT function as is.

You will also need the Quick Pager jquery plugin (quickpager.jquery.js), get it here: https://github.com/dan0/simplepager/tree/master/scripts

Stick it right in the flickerbrowser folder ([path to your modules dir]/flickrbrowser/quickpager.jquery.js), the module does not yet have integration with Libraries.
